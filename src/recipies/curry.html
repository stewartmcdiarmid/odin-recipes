    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Japanese curry or "kare raisu" (カレーライス), is a popular and comforting dish in Japan. It consists of a flavourful and thick curry sauce, served over steamed white rice. The curry sauce typically includes a mixture of vegetables (such as onions, carrots, and potatoes) and meat (commonly chicken, beef, or pork). The sauce is mildly spicy and slightly sweet, made from a roux that includes curry powder and other spices, often available in convenient curry cubes. Japanese curry rice is usually garnished with pickled vegetables called "fukujinzuke" and can be enjoyed as a hearty meal.</p>
